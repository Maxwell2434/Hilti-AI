# Hilti-AI

This is a project I developed during the Hilti IT Competition. Its function is to let the user query for anything related to Hitli and the AI will be able to return the answer and as well as the top 5 source documents that it used as reference for the answer. This solution utilizes a free AI model such as gemma/2b-IT obtained from huggingFace and a open source embedding model and as well a bunch of python libraries such as transformers and pytorch. The user interface is created using gradio.
