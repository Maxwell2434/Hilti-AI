The result is a resilient, high-performing global  team.

Relationship between national laws and BCR Hilti bound by the BCR implements very protective measures for the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects. The application of the highest data protection standards in all Hilti internal processes ensures that it develops its products and services in accordance with the principles set out in the BCR. Nevertheless, and in accordance with the provisions of   European data protection laws and regulations, there are  situations in which national laws and regulations may be  more protective than the principles set forth and applied  in the Hilti BCR or provide specific requirements. Where  such local legislation requires a higher level of protection  for Personal Data than those set forth in the BCR, it will take  precedence over the BCR. Where local legislation requires a  lower level of protection for Personal Data, the BCR will take  precedence. Such protective or additional provisions are assessed with  respect to the principles relating to the processing of Per- sonal Data.  As a consequence, any Hilti Entity undertakes to comply  with the applicable national or local provisions whenever  these have additional and protective effects for Data Sub- jects or provide specific provisions applicable in the country.  Each Hilti Entity is responsible for taking additional actions  where deemed necessary in accordance with the national  laws in which it is based. Such provisions include: •\\t Right for Data Subjects to decide on the fate of their Personal Data after death including exercising of rights by heirs or designated persons •\\t Processing of Personal Data in the field of employment, social security, or social protection law •\\t Application of Data Subject rights •\\t Conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) in accordance with specific local requirements •\\t Exercise DPO tasks in accordance with local requirements (e.g., secrecy obligation) Hilti Entities communicate to and provide the Regional Data  Protection Officer, the Global Team and CPO with a copy of  such local or national laws and applicable requirements. Where a Hilti Entity is taking actions, such as developing  local processes or policies, it must provide the Global Team  and CPO with a copy and details of such procedure or policy.  It has to be noted that such national laws do not override  BCR and are to be considered to be additional requirements  applicable in the country or state where the Hilti Entity is  based. In the event such new provisions are applicable in  one or several Hilti Entities, the latter must act and train  the relevant employees to ensure that such provisions are  implemented in existing processes or create new ones. Furthermore, there are cases where Hilti needs to assess  national requirements which may affect Personal Data  transfers.  In such case, Hilti will conduct an assessment prior to any  transfer of Personal Data to a third country.  This analysis is conducted by the exporting entity with  assistance of the importing entity to determine the con- ditions and circumstances by which the transfer can take  place, such as the categories of Personal Data transferred,  categories of Data Subjects, type of processing activity,  dataflow, evaluation of TOM’s as well as legislations, stat- utes, court orders or mandatory standards applicable to  such transfer of Personal Data and/or such importing entity.  Where the result of such assessment prevents the exporting  entity from fulfilling its obligations under the herewith BCR,  such exporting entity will either: •\\t Not start any transfer of Personal Data to the importing entity or •\\t For existing processing activities, discontinue any transfer of Personal Data or •\\t Implement supplementary measures in order to maintain the highest data protection standards as defined in the herewith BCR and in accordance with the latest EEA/ EDPB guidance In the event no supplementary measures can be put in  place, the exporting entity will either not start the processing  activity or suspend any transfer of Personal Data.
