Transparency, fairness, and lawfulness	 principles The principle of fairness and transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the  processing of Personal Data is easily accessible and easy to understand, as well as drafted in a clear and plain  language. Hilti will only process personal data in a  lawfully, fairly, and transparent manner. The principle of lawfulness means that the data processing is taking place according to a defined legal basis.",677,107,169.25
5,Hilti_BindingCorporateRules.pdf,"To ensure the application of these three main principles, Hilti has put in place various measures, these include: •	 Transparency measures for the processing (as detailed under BCR Section 6).",192,30,48.0
5,Hilti_BindingCorporateRules.pdf,"The applicable legal basis can either be:	 - Consent of the Data Subject	 - Contractual relationship or pre-contractual relationship with the Data Subject	 - Hilti’s legal obligations	 - 	The protection of vital interests of the Data Subject as well as of another natural person or, where applicable	 - 	The legitimate interests (by conducting a balance of interest’s assessment with Data Subjects’ rights, freedoms, and expectations) pursued by the Controller or by a Third-Party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the Data Subject which require protection of Personal Data, in particular where the Data Subject is a child The processing of special categories of Personal Data is lawful only where, in addition to the legal bases listed above, one of the following exemptions applies: •	 Explicit consent of the Data Subject •	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the Controller or of the Data Subject in the field of em- ployment and social security and social protection law •	 	Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another natural person where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent •	 Processing relates to Personal Data which are manifestly made public by the Data Subject •	 	Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity •	 	Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the Data Subject, in particular professional secrecy In order to make sure that there is no oversight, Hilti has put in place tools (see BCR Section 7) and will inform Data Subjects on the applicable legal basis along with the information Data Subjects are entitled to (see BCR Section 6). b. Purpose limitation This principle means Personal Data is collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Hilti ensures that Personal Data are processed only to fulfil its specific, clear, and legitimate purposes. Data Subjects are informed of such purposes which are defined before collecting Personal Data (see BCR Section 6).",2640,421,660.0

Hilti will only process Personal Data for a new purpose if and insofar as it has obtained consent from the Data Subject. However, such consent collection is not carried out where the new purpose for processing can be reasonably expected from Data Subjects. To determine whether a processing activity can be done for another purpose which is compatible with the initial purpose for which Personal Data is collected, Hilti takes into account: •	 Any link between the purposes for which Personal Data have been collected and the purposes for the intended further processing",682,111,170.5

Data minimization and accuracy The minimisation principle means that Personal Data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary  in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. The accuracy principle means that Personal Data must  be accurate and kept up to date. Inaccurate Personal  Data (based on the applicable purposes) must be erased or rectified.",967,148,241.75

The Personal Data retention period is defined in accordance with the processing activity by conducting the following assessment: •	 Definition of the purpose for processing Personal Data and the business needs:	 - Purpose for Personal Data processing	 - Estimated data retention period to achieve such purpose •	 Assessment of legal obligations	 - Review of data retention applicable legal and regulatory requirements	 - Duration of the processing activity •	 Balancing the Data Subjects interests, rights and freedoms	 - Evaluating Data Subjects’ interests and expectations	 - Assessing Hilti’s interests (such as responding to a claim) Hilti does not retain Personal Data longer than necessary, when such Personal Data is no longer needed.",1262,193,315.5
